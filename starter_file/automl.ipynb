    "This is a Capstone project in fulfilment of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of the Azure ML studio in training a model and deploying it. There are two ways Azure ML studio achieves this: one is through AUTOML, a codeless configuration that automates machine learning. Another, is the HYPERDRIVE, a custom hyperparameter tuning functionality for optimizing a ML model's performance. Then, from any of these two functionalities of the Azure ML studio, a production model will emerge to enable us explore the Azure ML End-to-End production pipeline solution for enabling interaction between a deployed model and other web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, the AUTOML outputed the VotingEnsemble model which is an ensemble of LightGBMClassifier and LogisticRegression classifier. The AUTOML best performing model, the VotingEnsemble, achieved a 99.978% accuracy.  "

This dataset is aimed at helping doctors during clinical diagnosis of liver disease to elevate burden and the stress involved in analyzing every single patients’ information. Therefore, the goal is to create a classifier that predicts whether a subject is healthy (non-liver patient) or ill (liver patient) based on some clinical and demographic features which are: age, gender, total Bilirubin, direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos."

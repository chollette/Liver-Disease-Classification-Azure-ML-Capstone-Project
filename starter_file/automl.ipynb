This dataset is aimed at helping doctors during clinical diagnosis of liver disease to elevate burden and the stress involved in analyzing every single patients’ information. Therefore, the goal is to create a classifier that predicts whether a subject is healthy (non-liver patient) or ill (liver patient) based on some clinical and demographic features which are: age, gender, total Bilirubin, direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos."
